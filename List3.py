Cricketers = [] 
for i in range(11):
      players_name = input("Enter player's name :  ")    #cant touch it with the edge
      Cricketers.append(players_name)     #phle players_name ki jagah i daaldia tha to last 
                                          #vala print horha tha bs 

# Also since python me {} use nhi krte like C, here to know ki 
# loop kaha tk h, loop k andar vali cheej ko margin leke likhte h 
# me cricketers.append() ko chipka kr likh rha tha margin se isliye
# galat result aarha tha  


print(Cricketers) 

#Wrote this code without learning about For loop in python isliye didnt knew about that
